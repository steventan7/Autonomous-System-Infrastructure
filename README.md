# Autonomous-System-Infrastructure

## Project Description
Established a ROS robotics platform used to create a server-client system that trains a convolutional neural network in PyTorch to implement autonomous driving in a remote smart car

Led a 6-member team to automate a remote robot to move and make appropriate stops and turns without human intervention using deep-learning algorithms

Wrote Python scripts that gave wireless control of a smart car with a joystick and collected 10 minutes of image and movement data used to train the self-driving systems
